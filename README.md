# Taskrunner exercise

- Create a task to merge and minify all the CSS/JS files into one file and add that file in the destination folder.
- Create a task to generate a sprite from the images that are located in the images/icons folder. The generated sprite file will be stored in the dist folder (dist/sprite.png);
- Create couple of tasks watch and compile:
  - “watch” – monitors changes in the files (js, sass, png) of the theme, automatically updates the browser page when fully recompiled.
  - “compile” just compiles the project and reflects automatically on the browser.
Watch and compile should cover the merge, minify and sprite generation as well.
